Our project is in progress, we have created Frontend to a great Extend and It can be accessed in front-end files and would start with index.html, we have also started our backend-work and created some models as well, our Login, register Page are working fine in Django project and some of the back-end functionalities are yet to be linked with front-end, At this stage User, instructor can login, Register and logout from the platform and we have also added the authentication, such that our portal can be accessed only after the login is done else it would direct it to landing page. Many functionalities are yet to be added and linking of front end and back end is remaiming to some extend,For now we have linkend the teacher and student page to the same login page but as we progress we would be having different login and registration page for students and teacher.
